# Hyplex

**Hy**personic **pl**asma **ex**pansion code (hyplex) is a 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) code for simulation of the expansion of a plasma plume generated by a electric thrusters. The code uses a rectangular domain, electrostatic fields, and the Monte-Carlo collisions (MCC) algorithm. 

## Description of the problem

(Include picture and description)


## Building

The code uses C++11. Before using the code it is necessary to install:

- Open MPI - https://www.open-mpi.org/
- HYPRE - https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre
- yaml-cpp - https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp

After installing Open MPI, place the files of HYPRE in `/lib/` and build it.

Then, build `yaml-cpp` and create a folder called `yaml` in `lib`. Place the file `libyaml-cpp.a` (from `<yaml-cpp folder>/build`) and the folder `yaml-cpp` (from `<yaml-cpp folder>/include`) in this new folder. After doing this you can delete the original `yaml-cpp` code and your `lib` file structure should look similar to this:

```
lib
├── args.h
├── date.h
├── filesystem.hpp
├── hypre-2.19.0
│   └── ...
└── yaml
    ├── libyaml-cpp.a
    └── yaml-cpp
        ├── contrib
        │   └── ...
        ├── node
        │   └── ...
        ├── yaml.h
        └── ...
```

After building MPI and HYPRE it is necessary to modify the `Makefile` to include the version of HYPRE, this is done modifying the variable `hypre_dir`  to the folder name that contains the library, e.g. , `hypre-2.16.0`. Finally, to build the code, just execute the command `make`. 

Compile with the `-D VERBOSE` flag in the variable `CXXFLAGS` to print more information during runtime.


### Backlog:

- Solving in cylindrical coordinates
- Do modular particle boundaries
