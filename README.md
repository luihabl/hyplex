# PIC plume

This is a 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) code for simulation of the expansion of a plasma plume generated by a plasma source. The code uses a rectangular domain, electrostatic fields, and the Monte-Carlo collisions (MCC) algorithm. 

## Description of the problem

(Include picture and description)


## Building

Before using the code it is necessary to install:

- Open MPI - https://www.open-mpi.org/
- HYPRE - https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre

Download HYPRE and extract it in the `/lib/` folder, then build the library in this folder.  After building MPI and HYPRE it is necessary to modify `compile.sh` to include the version of HYRE. Finally, to build the code, just execute the command `./compile.sh`. 

Compile with the `-D VERBOSE` flag to print more information during execution.

## To do

Next:

- Add second derivative boundary condition (d\phi^2/dx^2 = 0). How to use a 9-pt stencil in HYPRE?
- Smooth the calculation of E_crit with moving average. Is there a way to do this without having to calculate the energy of all particles every step?
- Add collisions with neutrals. First a uniform neutral density, and then a varying neutral density (DSMC). Maybe do external code to do the DSMC simulation? 
- Add a time-varying electron injection to the simulation
- Add an external circuit to the outer boundary when it is floating
- Correction of electric field in Dirichlet boundaries. How to correct in an interface between Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries?


Planned:

- Solving in cylindrical coordinates
